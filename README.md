# Portfolio

A single-page portfolio website built using Zurb Foundation Sites.

This is my portfolio!


## Requirements

This project uses the [Yarn package manager][yarn] to install dependencies
and run commands. On OS X, use [Homebrew][brew] to install Yarn.

```sh
brew install yarn
```

On other platforms, please visit the [Yarn][yarn] website for instructions.


## Develop

To start the development server, run the following command.

```sh
yarn start
```

This will start the build process, web server, and open your web browser to
view the portfolio website. Changes to source files will update the browser
automatically.


## Deploy

To build the site into a form suitable for upload to a static web server,
run the following command.

```sh
yarn build
```

This command will compile the source files into the `dist/` directory. The
contents of this directory are ready to be uploaded to a web server.
